 
These are the functional and structural MRI data used for the following study:

Coffey BJ, Threlkeld ZD, Bodien YB, Edlow BL. The language network reemerges during recovery from severe traumatic brain injury.
medRxiv 2020.01.10.20017004; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.10.20017004 

16 healthy control subjects participated in one session
8 patients with severe traumatic brain injury participated in two sessions

In the root directory, all structural T1 data were skull stripped using FSL's Brain Extraction Tool (bet) and reoriented using FSL fslutils fslreorient2std function. All functional BOLD data were reoriented using FSL fslutils fslreorient2std function.

All acquisition parameters are as described in the above reference with the following exceptions:
